You may use this endpoint to verify user's email address. This does not send verification email but only validate the token sent in the already sent verification email.

## Example

```
https://domain.abc/auth/verify-email/process/?token=ESNtke7pHsxMUSG7AnnCoh7nPr_hEHA-X4Yn8ocMTzsv_1j-Mufxc6bw
```

You would send this url to the user in their welcome email and once they click it, they will land on this page which will verify their email.

> [!NOTE]
> Axor automatically sends welcome email with verification link. You can change the underlying url in case you want to write your own verification flow.

## Change Verification URL

If you are writing your own verification component, you can provide your custom url by modifying setting
`AXOR_AUTH.EMAIL_VERIFICATION_LINK`.

```python
AXOR_AUTH = {
    'EMAIL_VERIFICATION_LINK': 'auth/verify-email/process/?token=<token>'
}
```

`<token>` will be replaced by the actual token generated by the system. This gets prefixed by the `AXOR_AUTH.FRONTEND_URL` to give full URL.
